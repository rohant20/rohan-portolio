                        <p>I am currently a second-year, undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of
                            Central Florida
                            looking to land my first
                            internship
                            in the industry.

                            <br>
                            I'm extremely impacted by products and projects that influence the
                            world and progress society/culture forward. Originally I felt this way about music, then
                            film, but ever since I started exploring technology, specifically Computer Science, that's
                            all it's been about.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Before we can get to that though, I'd love for
                            you to take a trip, or scroll, with me, as I tell you who I am.

                        <p>I was born and raised in Reading, PA. I give a lot of credit to my hometown for shaping me to
                            be who I am now. Due to what I had to do to keep myself entertained, and who I met, I picked
                            up pieces of personailties growing up, that I used to help mold my own. Personality
                            wasn't
                            the only thing that was a melting pot for me, though.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            My mother
                            is from Puerto Rico and my from father is from
                            India. I am fourtunate enough to have had two parents and a sister who I saw as role models.
                            My mom was a Chemist, my dad is a Software Engineer, and my sister is attending graduate
                            school at American University.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            They all enstilled hard-working DNA into me, along
                            with an understanding of the importance found in communication and team-work. They pushed
                            education, but at the same time urged that I experienced the world that I lived in.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            They are what shaped me to be who I am today. If you guys are seeing this, thanks, but
                            respectfully, let's keep talking about me.

                        <h3 class="border-bottom subTitle">Computer Science Career</h3>
                        <p>When I was in 6th grade I was in the gifted program that our school offered. The point of the
                            program was to offer extra stimulation to kids who were "too gifted"(whatever that means)
                            for the normal cirriculum. It was in this program that I was first introduced to the world
                            of Computer Science. Sure, it may have only been block coding to make a Scratch game, but I
                            was hooked once I started.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            To be honest, I don't know what it was, but from that point on my academic focus was always
                            STEM, specifically programming. I started teaching myself other languages, and by the time I
                            hit 8th grade, I was making websites for fun and messing around with Raspberry Pis. The
                            first place that I actually applied my programming interest was in a club called Technology
                            Student Association(TSA). My friends and I would compete in web design, game development,
                            and robotics competitions against other kids in Pennsylvania. I loved it.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I would spend hours working on those projects, and it paid off when we won 2nd and 7th in
                            the state, for two seperate competitions, my senior year of high school. This motivated me
                            to
                            persue a degree in Computer Science at UCF, which I can still confidently say is something
                            I'm very passionate about. Computer Science was not my first passion, though.

                        <h3 class="border-bottom subTitle">Music and Film</h3>
                        <p>I was probably one bad programming experience away from going to UCF to be a film major. I
                            love film, and even more than film, I love music. The way that I approach my work on
                            Computer Science projects can be largely related to my perspective on music and film.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            When I say I loved music, I really mean it. I taught myself all about music production,
                            songwriting, sound quality, sound formatting, and so much more. I would study my favorite
                            albums, from stories they are telling, all the way to how the order of the album helps it
                            effectivness. This obsession with music soon led to a similar obsession with film. I found
                            myself captivated by visually pleasing shots, color palletes, and screenwriting. The art
                            behind these two forms of media were my passion, and to be honest, I still feel that way
                            about them.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Once I started to find a real interest for Computer Science, it was difficult. I didn't
                            know if it was smart to be so invested in two things I don't have an aptitude for while I
                            really enjoyed programming. Then I started to realize that Computer Science is MY music, and
                            Progamming/Development are MY films.

                        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                        <p>My favorite albums are albums that effected society and pushed the culture of music forward.
                            Music that
                            had the ability to change people's lives captivated me, and I found that those were the
                            artists who would continue to produce solid pieces of work. In theory, it is easy to make
                            something that sounds good, but the real skill and real impact comes from music that can
                            change people's lives for the better. This is the same way that I approach Software.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I believe that there is so much technology can help society with, but it takes a team of
                            minds to put together projects that influence the world. In my opinion, there is so much
                            more power in a project that helps people in life versus a project that has cool functions
                            and makes a lot of money.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I am only 19 years old, but I am so excited to potentially work for companies that are
                            creating techonology with the goal of helping change people's lives. I'm not able to play
                            any
                            instuments, nor am I talented enough to write a script for a high school play. What I can
                            do, is
                            contrubute to projects that have real life purpose. I'm beyond excited to see where my
                            journey takes me!
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I hope you enojyed learning
