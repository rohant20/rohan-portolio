                                        regionally, and in the state of Pennsylvania. <strong>We developed three
                                            websites for the three seperate years we competed</strong>, but this section

                                        As the lead developer, I took the ideas that our lead designers would come up
                                        with and <strong>them into reality</strong>, through the use of <strong>HTML,
                                            CSS,
                                            JavaScript,
                                            Bootstrap, and media assets.</strong> There were multiple designs, images,
                                        and assets
                                        that needed to be implemented from the designs into the websites. <strong> This
                                            requires
                                            great communication between myself and my designer.</strong> This website
                                        was for a mock telemedicine company. The company that we came up with was called
                                        “EVE”. The landing page (shown on the left) is a great example of a design that
                                        <strong>required massive amounts of communication</strong> to execute.

                                            for easy access to the rest of the pages of the website, while providing
                                            enough
                                            information to let the user know what would be featured.

                                        In addition to utilizing our <strong>technical skills</strong>, we also had to
                                        immerse ourselves in the intricacies of <strong>documentation</strong>,
                                        <strong>presentation</strong>, and <strong>usage rights</strong>. This process
                                        involved understanding how to meticulously <strong>document our work</strong>,
                                        ensuring that every step and decision was clearly recorded and could be easily
                                        referenced by others. We also had to master the art of <strong>presenting our
                                            findings and creations</strong> in a coherent and compelling manner,
                                        tailored to various audiences ranging from <strong>technical peers</strong> to
                                        <strong>non-technical stakeholders</strong>. Moreover, we delved into the
                                        complex world of <strong>usage rights</strong>, learning how to navigate legal
                                        considerations related to <strong>intellectual property</strong>,
                                        <strong>licensing agreements</strong>, and <strong>ethical use of
                                            resources</strong>. This comprehensive approach not only enhanced our
                                        <strong>technical capabilities</strong> but also equipped us with valuable
                                        skills in <strong>communication</strong> and <strong>legal awareness</strong>.

                                        These websites were primarily focused on <strong>frontend development and
                                            design</strong>, ensuring that the user interface was both visually
                                        appealing and highly functional. The design process involved creating
                                        aesthetically pleasing layouts, selecting appropriate color schemes, and
                                        incorporating intuitive navigation elements to enhance the user experience.

                                            The use of <strong>good practice in code</strong>, such as

                                            <strong>Git resources</strong>, were necessary in order for us to be
                                            successful. Implementing <strong>comments</strong> throughout our code
                                            ensured that it was easily understandable and maintainable by anyone on the
                                            team or future developers. A well-organized <strong>project
                                                structure</strong> allowed us to keep our files and directories

                                            efficient. Additionally, utilizing <strong>Git resources</strong> for
                                            version control enabled us to track changes, collaborate seamlessly, and
                                            revert to previous versions when necessary. These practices collectively
                                            ensured that our projects were not only robust and efficient but also
                                            sustainable and scalable.

                                            content</strong>, and <strong>dynamic visuals</strong> to tell the

                                        story. We included sections that highlighted the company’s history, mission,

                                        core values, all presented through a mix of <strong>animated

                                        <strong>video snippets</strong>, and <strong>interactive timelines</strong>.
                                        This approach not only made the information more accessible and interesting

                                <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until
                                the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element.
                                These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS
                                transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default
                                variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the
                                <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
